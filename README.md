# OPAMP

Two stage  Operational Amplifier Design for high speed application
This repository contains the complete design, simulation, and analysis files for a two-stage CMOS Operational Amplifier implemented in Cadence Virtuoso using the 90nm technology node.
https://github.com/MUDDUKRISHNAY/OPAMP/edit/main/README.md#design-methodology

## Design Methodology

The amplifier was designed using textbook design flow from **Allen & Holberg**:
- Sizing based on slew rate, gain, and compensation needs
- Two-stage topology with Miller compensation
- Biasing and gain optimization using hand calculations
- Verification via Spectre simulation (AC, transient, stability)


## Overview

The design targets high gain and stability with high slew rate, optimized for analog signal processing applications.
